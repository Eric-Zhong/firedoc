Overview
--------

FireDoc is forked from YUIDoc and mainly supported the following features:

- direct members of module
- file-based `@example`
- single-line `@property`
- added new tag `@enum`
- added new tag `@callback`
- added "Inherited tree"

YUIDoc is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) application used at build time to
generate API documentation for JavaScript code. YUIDoc is comment-driven and supports a wide
range of JavaScript coding styles. The output of YUIDoc is API documentation formatted as a
set of HTML pages including information about methods, properties, custom events and
inheritance for JavaScript objects.

YUIDoc was originally written for the YUI Project; it uses YUI JavaScript and CSS in the
generated files and it supports common YUI conventions like Custom Events. That said,
it can be used easily and productively on non-YUI code.

Installation
------------

```sh
$ npm install -g firedoc
```

Usage
-------

```sh
$ firedoc source-path --lang
```

`--lang` option is required for multi-language description. Currently firedoc supports `--en` and `--zh` language option. Adding those option will generate docs for that specific language.

`--markdown` or `--md` is optional flag, which lets you get the markdown-based documentation to
directly host at Github or Bitbucket. [Firedoc](https://github.com/fireball-x/firedoc)'s github
hosted documentation is generated by itself.

Test
-------------

To run test
```sh
$ npm test
```
